# TODO APP

### Video Demo: 

### Description:
The final propject that I created allows the user to create a list about what 
they are going to do, fortunately even though that idea is kind of really 
cliche but since I was just starting about a web developement, I think it is fair enough
to start with a simple CRUD but has a log ing system. 


- ### Login: 
First, the user will be prompt of a log in form. The user will need to provide information and the database 
script that I did create will validated it, by the way the database that I used for this project 
is MySql database, it is kind of making an extra mile for me since it was an outside this to do in
since it was not included in a cs50 library, I want to use something that actually can be use without 
the cs50 provided library. 

- ### Signup:
Second if the database can't validate the user information what basically hapen is that 
the user will be prompted with an error message regarding of the information that the users provide
about a non-existing user after that the user has a choic to create an account just by clicking 
"Create an account" button. In that way the user will be able to create an account. Right after that 
Now the user can log in through the login page. 

- ### Creating a list:
Third right after the user logged in for sure it will be valid and now the user will be prompted to the point
where the user can see that there were no data or "TODO" list anywhere. For the user to create a todo list
First if they see a textbox that is they were be able to input the task that they need to do an just by hitting 
the enter on their keyboard or clicking the "+" button the list will be popped or if there any existing list, the new task will be 
added.
- ### Removing the list:
Fourth if they are done with their task, they can easily click the "Done" button, by doing that the task 
that they inputted will be deleted immediately, and then what basically happen is that it will be also removed
in the database which is in the Mysql workbench but Since I connected workbench and xampp we can see it both in those 
softwares. 

- ### Logging Out
Fifth and we can say the finally, you will be able to see the logout button and just by clicking that the home page or login page will
popped out and then the user needs to log in again if they need to add thing to do.
